# Mobile Styles

This folder contains mobile-specific styling files.

## Files

- `mobile.css` - Mobile-specific CSS styles
  - Smooth transitions for mobile menu animations
  - Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px for better touch targets)
  - Mobile menu enter/exit animations

## Note

Since this project uses Tailwind CSS with responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.), most mobile styling is handled directly in components using Tailwind classes. This folder contains custom CSS for animations and touch-friendly interactions that enhance the mobile experience.
